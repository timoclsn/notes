Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to share a quick AI success story as a result of our AI exercise from today's breakfast.

I used AI to tackle something that I wanted to try for a bit:

On our Steuerbot website, we switched CSS technologies a few years ago from CSS modules using Sass to type-safe CSS using Vanilla Extract. Back then, we converted a handful of components and then said every time a component is touched, it should be converted to VE. New components should be created with VE, of course. But we never fully migrated all components, which to this day leads, e.g., to quite a bit of duplicated CSS because of shared styles in both technologies.

I used the cursor agent in YOLO mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7.

I got it into a good feedback/iteration loop by prompting it to convert all remaining .sass files to .css.ts. I told it to have a look at the existing .css.ts files to see how they are set up and used. For feedback, I told it to do each component one by one, and after each conversion, to run a type check for a quick test to see that nothing major broke. After every couple of components (10 or so), I told it to navigate to the dev server, look for errors in the console, and fix them. This way, it automatically fixed broken VE syntax. In the end I opened a new chat and told it to do code review and compare the git diffs of the .sass and .css.ts files. It found some errors and e.g. improved global var usage further.

Some stats:

It successfully converted 86 components (I didn't find a issue while testing for now).

It ran for 2 - 3 hours (I could do other things while it ran and just had to check in at some points).

It burned through the Sonnet context window for about 10 times (so I had to summarize and start a new chat).

Pro: I think doing it by hand would have taken one developer maybe 1 - 2 weeks.

Con: If I had done it by hand, I think I would also have optimized the CSS for the new technology. I opted for a 1:1 conversion for now to make it more predictable.
