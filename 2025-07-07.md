This approach uses PowerShell's native `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet which:

1. **Creates a proper PowerShell hashtable object** with the data
2. **Converts it to properly formatted JSON** with all quotes intact
3. **Should work consistently** across different PowerShell environments

You can test this locally with:

```powershell
$releaseData = @{
  platform = "windows"
  version = "test-version"
  downloads = @{
    intel = @{
      "app-bundle" = "test-path-1"
      "updater-bundle" = "test-path-2"
      signature = "test-path-3"
    }
    "intel-store" = @{
      "app-bundle" = "test-path-4"
    }
  }
}

$RELEASE_NOTES = $releaseData | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
Write-Host $RELEASE_NOTES
```

This should be much more reliable than manually constructing JSON strings.
