Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

As I was encouraged to share more agentic coding examples, I let the agent do a nice refactor of our design system colors on the steuerbot website.

There were a couple of updates in the design system colors:

-  Color names changed
-  Color steps are gone
-  Colors added
-  Colors removed
-  Etc.

To update it in the whole codebase, I let Cursor with Sonnet-4 do all the work:

We have one design token file where all the colors are defined.

I prompted it with a screenshot of the new color system in Figma and told it to change the tokens file accordingly.

It made some mistakes reading the colors, so I re-prompted it using the Figma MCP. This time I could read the new color values without mistakes.

Afterwards, I just told it to sort the tokens in the way I like it.

But now came the bigger step. I told it to update the color tokens in the whole project.

It started by using its read and write file tool calls. That was very slow and inefficient. After the first round of edits, I told it to be more efficient and do more of a search and replace process, and then use the type check to confirm that everything worked.

It took my advice and switched to a CLI-based search and replace process (using find) and finished the task pretty quickly.

See the screenshots for the different steps ðŸ˜Š

Nothing groundbreaking, but I liked the process and the teamwork (extracting the colors and helping it do it more efficiently) ðŸ˜‰
